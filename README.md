Some good docs:

https://sourcethemes.com/academic/post/managing-content/
https://sourcethemes.com/academic/post/widgets/

Note there's also an example website bundled with the template; you've deleted a lot of the files (since they weren't necessary for your current needs), may be worth consulting. This is in themes/academic/exampleSite 

Just run "hugo" to regenerate everything.
