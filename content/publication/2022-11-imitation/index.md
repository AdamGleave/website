abstract: imitation provides open-source implementations of imitation and reward learning algorithms in PyTorch. We include three inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithms, three imitation learning algorithms and a preference comparison algorithm. The implementations have been benchmarked against previous results, and automated tests cover 98% of the code. Moreover, the algorithms are implemented in a modular fashion, making it simple to develop novel algorithms in the framework. Our source code, including documentation and examples, is available [here](https://github.com/HumanCompatibleAI/imitation).
