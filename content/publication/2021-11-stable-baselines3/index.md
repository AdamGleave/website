abstract: Stable-Baselines3 provides open-source implementations of deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in Python. The implementations have been benchmarked against reference codebases, and automated unit tests cover 95% of the code. The algorithms follow a consistent interface and are accompanied by extensive documentation, making it simple to train and compare different RL algorithms. Our documentation, examples, and source-code are available at https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3.
