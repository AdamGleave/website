abstract: The majority of online content is written in languages other than English,
  and is most commonly encoded in UTF-8, the worldâ€™s dominant Unicode character encoding.
  Traditional compression algorithms typically operate on individual bytes. While
  this approach works well for the single-byte ASCII encoding, it works poorly for
  UTF-8, where characters often span multiple bytes. Our paper introduces a technique
  to modify byte-by-byte compressors to operate directly on Unicode characters. We
  demonstrate this technique applied to LZW and PPM, finding our variant substantially
  outperforms the original unmodified compressors.
