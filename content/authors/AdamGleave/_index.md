I am the CEO and co-founder of [FAR AI](https://far.ai), an alignment research non-profit working to incubate and accelerate new alignment research agendas. I received my PhD from UC Berkeley under the supervision of [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/). I was fortunate to be part of the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai/) during my PhD and funded by an Open Philanthropy Fellowship. Previously, I've spent time at DeepMind working with [Jan Leike](https://jan.leike.name/) and [Geoffrey Irving](https://naml.us/), and Cambridge working with [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Christian Steinruecken](https://q4.github.io/). Please see my [CV](/cv.pdf) for a more comprehensive list of my prior experience.
