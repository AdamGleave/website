I am a final-year artificial intelligence (AI) PhD candidate at UC Berkeley, advised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/) and part of the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai/). My focus is on out-of-distribution robustness for deep RL, with a particular emphasis on value learning and multi-agent adversarial robustness. I am a board member for the non-profit [Fund for Alignment Research](https://alignmentfund.org/), and an advisor to [Aligned AI](https://buildaligned.ai/).

I have had the pleasure of collaborating with [Jan Leike](https://jan.leike.name/) and [Geoffrey Irving](https://naml.us/) during internships at DeepMind. Prior to joining Berkeley, I was fortunate to work with [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Christian Steinruecken](https://q4.github.io/) during my Master's degree in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. Please see my [CV](/cv.pdf) for a more comprehensive list of my prior experience.
