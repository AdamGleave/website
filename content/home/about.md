# Biography

I am an artificial intelligence (AI) PhD student at UC Berkeley, supervised by [Stuart Russell](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/). My goal is to develop techniques necessary for advanced automated systems to verifiably act according to human preferences, even in situations unanticipated by their designer. I am particularly interested in improving methods for value learning and preference elicitation, such as inverse reinforcement learning. 

I work closely with the [Center for Human-Compatible AI](http://humancompatible.ai/), a cross-disciplinary research centre. Prior to joining Berkeley, I had the pleasure of working with [Zoubin Ghahramani](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/zoubin/) and [Christian Steinruecken](https://q4.github.io/) during my Master's degree in the [Machine Learning Group](http://mlg.eng.cam.ac.uk/) at the University of Cambridge. Please see my [CV](CV.pdf) for a more comprehensive list of my prior experience.
