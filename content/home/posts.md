Some of my opinions are best expressed in formats other than an academic paper.
Here are a few of my more notable interviews and essays:

[Writing Beautifully in LaTeX](/post/latex-design-patterns/) (August 2020).
Design patterns for composing LaTeX documents.
 
[Careers in Beneficial AI Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFo7_9JVmt0z8RPwUjB-mUMgCMoUQmsaj2CM5aHvxCw/edit) (July 2020).
A guide for those interested in AI research careers that have a social impact, with a focus on graduate school.

[Conversation with AI Impacts](https://aiimpacts.org/conversation-with-adam-gleave/) (August 2019).
